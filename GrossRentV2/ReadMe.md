Gross Bedroom Rent by State

This is a personal project. The data comes from the US Census Bureau. I code this in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. After I finish the first version, I got the following feedback and made changes accordingly on the second version.
​

### Feedback:

1. For the line chart, readers may be overwhelmed by the huge amount of lines. 
​
2. Since there aren't any standout regional trends, the map may not be the best way to show the data.

### Changes:

1. A dropdown menu and a national average number, which are helpful for readers to read the lines and compare the numbers. 
​
2. A table with a color scale to show all the numbers. The table makes it easier for readers to find their state and compare against the state.
