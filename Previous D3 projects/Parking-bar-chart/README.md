# PARKING-BAR-CHART

The interactive bar chart was originally an infographic of my group multimedia project, “Parking tickets are on the rise in Columbia.” The original work is here: http://www.manyunzou.com/#!Parking-tickets-are-on-the-rise-in-Columbia/sz7yv/566b6d060cf239106877abd4

This is my very first time to use d3 to build up an interactive chart. I coded the graphic based on Justin Palmer’s block, “Using d3-tip to add tooltip to a d3 bar chart” (http://bl.ocks.org/Caged/6476579) and his tooltip example, “explicit-target.html” (https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip/blob/master/examples/explicit-target.html).
