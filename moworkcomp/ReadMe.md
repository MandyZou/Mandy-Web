# Missouri Workers' Compensation
This is a re-production of my story about Missouri Workers' Compensation. The story was inspired by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/workers-compensation"> a ProPublica project</a>. <a href="https://www.manyunzou.com/single-post/2015/12/04/Missouri-workers%E2%80%99-compensation-falls-short-of-national-average">My original story</a> includes mainly text and audio piece. Now, I add two interactive graphics in order to show the numbers difference in a more powerful way. And I also update the web production to make it look like a feature story.
